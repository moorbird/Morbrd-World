                    <p>An artist / designer - myself. I have a love for the tangible and performing art world and have a hate-love relationship for the tech world. Being fed up with the slop that is online and that is being scraped to train AI models, Iâ€™ve decided to showcase and store my images, thoughts, and videos on my own website - and I'd like to share it with you.</p>

                    <p>My online persona is "Morbrd," its a little bit or morbid and a little bit of more birds.</p>
                    <br>
                   <p> My young and current adult life has been an avdventure, from working as a lighting tech for the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly hills, to being a second AD in an indie horror film, training in costume design, and aging costumes for a fox studio produciton - You see... I've never actually known what the hell I wanted to do with my life. Isn't that fun?</p>
